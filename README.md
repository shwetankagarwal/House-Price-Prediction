# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression. Two different approaches are implemented: one using a single variable and another using multiple variables.

## Single Variable Approach

In the single variable approach, the house price is predicted based on a single feature, such as the area of the house. The linear regression model is trained using the historical data of house prices and their corresponding areas. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its area.

## Multiple Variable Approach

In the multiple variable approach, the house price is predicted based on multiple features, such as the area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The linear regression model is trained using the historical data of house prices and their corresponding features. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is provided in the `data` folder. It contains information about various houses, including their prices and features.
